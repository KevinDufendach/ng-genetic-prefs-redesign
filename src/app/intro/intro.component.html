    <p>We are doing a study that includes genetic testing of DNA. Genetic testing could tell us about a disease a person
      has. It could tell us if a person might develop a disease during their lifetime.</p>
    <p>Some studies may give you the option to learn genetic results. The following questions will help you decide what
      types of results you would like to learn. You can also choose which results you don’t want to learn.</p>
    <p>Please answer the following questions. You can change your answers to the questions. As you answer questions,
      some diseases in the list may be crossed out. You can always add a disease back in. You can also click on a
      disease to learn more about it.</p>

      <p>Using this tool may help you decide if you want to learn any genetic results. If you answer, “Yes, I want the
        chance to learn my/my child’s genetic results,” you will be asked 4 more questions. You will be able to see the
        type of diseases you could learn about based on your answers to the 4 questions. If you do not want to learn any
        results, you can come back to this question and answer, “No, I do not want to receive any genetic results.”</p>

        <p>Some genetic diseases are caused by gene variations that come from BOTH parents. A carrier only has one copy of
          the gene variation so a carrier wonâ€™t get the disease. Carriers are at risk of having children with the genetic
          disease if their partner also is a carrier for the same disease.</p>

          <p>An example of a disease that is caused by gene variations that come from both parents is sickle cell disease.
            When a parent has only one gene variation for sickle cell disease, the parent is a carrier for sickle cell but
            does not have the disease. When two parents are carriers for sickle cell disease, they have a 25% or a one in
            four chance of having a child with sickle cell disease.</p>

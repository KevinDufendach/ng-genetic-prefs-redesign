        <p>Preventable diseases have medical or lifestyle steps you can take before the disease begins. For example,
          surgery, lifelong medicine, or lifestyle changes can reduce the risk of getting some diseases. For diseases that
          are not preventable, there are no known steps that will stop the disease from happening.</p>

          <p>An example of a disease that can sometimes be genetic is colon cancer. Colon cancer usually begins as a small
            clump of cells called a polyp. Polyps are not cancer but can turn into cancer over time. Colon cancer can be
            prevented if polyps are removed from the colon before they turn into cancer. Researchers are trying to find ways
            to prevent polyps. If colon cancer occurs, it can be cured with surgery, radiation, medicine or any combination
            of the three treatments. The chances for cure are much higher if the cancer is found and treated early.</p>

          <p>An example of a type of genetic disease that can’t be prevented is inherited tumor syndromes. In these types of
            diseases, tumors can start in different parts of the body. Tumors are not always cancer but if noncancerous
            tumors get too big they can cause many different problems and even death. If tumors occur, they can sometimes be
            removed by surgery. Sometimes medicines or radiation might be needed to shrink the tumors before surgery.
            Sometimes tumors can’t be removed by surgery.</p>

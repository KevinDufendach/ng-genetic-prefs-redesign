          <p>An example of a disease that can sometimes be genetic is colon cancer. Colon cancer is considered a disease
            that occurs in adults. Colon cancer usually begins as a small clump of cells called a polyp. Polyps are not
            cancer but can turn into cancer over time. Polyps usually occur in adults. People who have polyps usually do not
            know they have them because polyps usually do not cause any symptoms.</p>

          <p>Colon cancer can be prevented if polyps are removed from the colon before they turn into cancer. Screening is a
            process of looking for polyps in people who do not have any symptoms. Colon cancer screening is recommended for
            all adults starting at age 50. People who have a gene that increases their risk for colon cancer need to start
            screening earlier. With regular screening, most polyps can be found and removed before they turn into cancer. If
            colon cancer occurs, it can be cured with surgery, radiation, medicine or any combination of the three
            treatments. The chances for cure are much higher if the cancer is found and treated early.</p>

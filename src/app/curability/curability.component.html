      <p>An example of a disease that can sometimes be genetic is thyroid cancer. Thyroid cancer can be cured with
        surgery, radiation, medicine or any combination of the three treatments. However, not all thyroid cancers can be
        cured. The chances for cure are much higher if the cancer is found and treated early.</p>

      <p>Another example of a disease that can sometimes be genetic is heart muscle disease. When heart muscle becomes
        too thick or too thin, it can’t be cured. However medicine, a pace maker, lifestyle changes or any combination
        of the three treatments can improve the heart’s ability to pump blood. Once treatments begin, they are usually
        lifelong.</p>
